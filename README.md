This is the code for a lightweight webapp to identify a guitar model and make from a picture. While basic functionality is present, the classifier itself is currently still under development and only supports a small selection of guitar models. 

The classifier is currently based on mobilenet-v3, a small pretrained CNN-based model, and runs clientside in an onnx runtime.
