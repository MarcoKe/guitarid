Most Ibanez model numbers have three sections:\n\nA series code,\nthe specific model number,\none or two suffixes.\nA model number could look like this: RG3520Z where RG is the code for RG series, the specific model number is 3520 and the suffix is Z. Sometimes, for instance in catalogs, the abbreviation defining the model finish is included to the model number, so you would get RG3520Z HBK or even RG3520ZHBK (without the space).\n\nFor guitars of recent vintage, the model number is often stamped or painted on the reverse of the instrument's headstock. For earlier instruments, the information in this article along with the serial number can be used to ascertain the model number.\n\nSeries code\nThe first one to three letters of a model name generally indicates the series to which that model belongs. The series code usually is an abbreviation of the series name. For the RG series models it's RG and for S series models S. For Steve Vai's signature JEM series the code is JEM and for his Universe series it's UV. Joe Satriani signatures use the JS designation. Most other signature guitars employ a naming convention using the artist's initials followed with an M (presumably standing for Model), for example see Paul Gilbert's PGM line.\n\nSeries code prefix\n\nIn some cases characters are added to the beginning of the model number before the series code. Some cases where this occurs include:\n\nG = model belongs to the entry-level GIO line (e.g. GAX30, GRG121)\nJC = model belongs to the handcrafted J Custom line (e.g. JCRG2011Z)\nUS = model belongs to the USA Custom line (e.g. USRG30)\nJapanese retailer spot model prefixes\n\nIn some cases Ibanez produces spot models which are for sale exclusively by particular retailers in Japan. These models are identified by a prefix on the model number exclusive to each retailer. Some of these retailer codes are:\n\nH - Ikebe Gakki (HRG1802)\nI - Ishibashi (IRG8470F)\nK - Musicland Key (KRG1502)\nM - Kurosawa Gakki (MRG500)\nR - Rock Inn (RRG1)\nS - Shimamura Gakki (SRG450QMZD)\nW - Watanabe Gakki (WRGR13B)\nY - Yamano (YJCRG2)\nSeries code suffix\n\nOccasionally additional characters are appended to the end of the series code, but before the numeric portion of the model number. These characters have specific meanings:\n\nB = body binding (e.g. RGB570M)\nM = part of the miKro series of short-scale intruments (e.g. GRGM21)\nR = Reversed headstock (e.g. RGR321EX)\nS = Set-in neck construction (e.g. SAS36FM, GRGS22)\nT = neck-Thru construction (e.g. RGT6EXFX)\nNote that some models may have more than one of these series code suffixes (e.g. RGRT47DX).\n\nFor the Iron Label series introduced in 2013, models are given a two character identifier after the series code and before the number. These include:\n\nIB = Baritone model (e.g. RGIB6)\nIF = Fanned-fret, multi-scale fingerboard (e.g. RGIF7)\nIM = Multi-scale, fanned-fret fingerboard (e.g. RGIM7MH)\nIR = Rosewood fretboard (e.g. RGIR20E, ARZIR20)\nIT = neck-Thru construction (e.g. RGIT28FE)\nIX = ebony fretboard and abalone binding on the body (e.g. SIX27FDBG, RGDIX7MPB). It's not clear what the X stands for in this case, perhaps deluXe.\nSpecific model number conventions\nThe specific model number, usually 3 or 4 digits, defines the model and its place within the series. There is a certain system for the model numbers, but it suffers from all kinds of exceptions. The RG series uses this system since 1987. For the S series (including derivatives), it has been fully implemented since 2001, although it already has been used for some models introduced since 1987. Other series that have used this system are the Ergodyne and Talman series\n\nThe thousands and hundred digits indicate the quality class (and with that, the price-range) of the guitar with the basic rule: The higher the number, the higher the class.\nThe 100 and 200 series guitars are usually produced in low-wage countries with cheaper components. Most of them now fall within the entry-level GIO line.\nModels with four digit numbers (from 1000 and on) now fall within the Prestige range, the higher quality class guitars, usually produced in Japan, although there are some Korea produced Prestige guitars. An exception are numbers starting with 7 (so for instance, the S7320). This 7 indicates that this is a 7-string guitar. Actually these guitars are part of the S7 and RG7 subseries.\nThe second to last (tens) digit defines the pickup configuration, whether a pickguard is installed and sometimes whether the headstock matches the body:\n10\tSingle humbucker (H) pickup configuration (e.g. RG2610E)\n20\tHH pickup configuration (e.g. RG1520A)\n30\tSSS pickup configuration with pickguard (e.g. SA130FM) or\nHH pickup configuration with pickguard (e.g. RG331M)\n40\tHSS pickup configuration with pickguard (e.g. RT140)\n50\tHSH pickup configuration with pickguard (e.g. RG1550)\n60\tHSS pickup configuration without pickguard (e.g. RG560)\n70\tHSH pickup configuration without pickguard (e.g. RG1570)\n80\tHSH with direct-mount humbuckers (e.g. RG380)\nThe last (ones) digit gives some extra information:\n0\tnot specified or standard to the series; typically it has a tremolo\n1\tfixed bridge guitar (e.g. RG1521)\n2\t12-string guitar (e.g. RG1512, RT452)\n5\tD-Tuner equipped (e.g. S1675FM) or missing a middle single coil (e.g. RG565)\n7\tSeven-string guitar (e.g. RG1527)\n8\tEight-string guitar (e.g. RG2228)\n9\tNine-string guitar (e.g. RG9QM)\nNaming strategy for Prestige models from 2014\n\nStarting in 2014 a new naming convention was added for certain models in the Prestige line. These models use three digit numbers where the first (hundreds) digit indicates the number of strings: 6, 7 or 8. The second (tens) digit identifies the quality class (as described above for the hundreds digit in the typical naming system). The final digit identifying the pickup/ pickguard configuration (as described above for the tens digit. These can be thought of as versions of the typical naming convention with the ones digit truncated.\n\nAn example of this naming strategy is the RG655, which is a six-string guitar with pickguard-mounted pickups in an HSH configuration. This model is can be considered essentially a direct descendant of the original RG550. One can think of it as the RG655(0).\n\nOther examples of this sort of naming convention include: RG652FX (six-string with pickguard-mounted dual humbuckers with a fixed bridge), RG752 (seven-string with dual humbuckers with a pickguard and a tremolo bridge) and the RG852 (eight-string with two pickguard-mounted humbuckers with a fixed bridge).\n\nNaming strategy for AZ and AZS models\n\nA new wrinkle to the naming strategy was introduced with the AZ series in 2018. AZS series introduced in 2021 followed that convention. As with other series, the model names start with the series abbreviation (AZ). The next two digits in the AZ model names indicate the number of frets (either 22 or 24). Models in the Prestige line then have a 0 in the third digit. The fourth digit of Prestige models or the third digit of Premium models indicates the pickup configuration using a similar convention as used with other series, as follows:\n\n0\tSH pickup configuration without pickguard\n2\tHH pickup configuration\n3\tSSS pickup configuration\n4\tHSS pickup configuration with pickguard\n6\tHSS pickup configuration without pickguard\n7\tHSH pickup configuration without pickguard\n9\tSH pickup configuration with pickguard\nFinally many models append a suffix to the end consisting of letters that indicate something else about the model (typically the material used for an exotic wood top).\n\nLooking at an example the AZ2402Q we can break it down. The AZ indicates the series, the 24 indicates it has 24 frets, the 0 indicates its part of the Prestige line, the 2 indicates it has dual humbucking pickups and the Q indicates it has a quilted maple top.\n\nModel number suffixes\nFor More about this topic, see List of suffixes used for model names.\nIn some cases addition characters are appended to the end of the model name, after the numeric model number. Common suffixes include: DX (deluxe), E (EMG pickups), FM (flamed maple top), QM (quilted maple top) and Z (Edge Zero tremolo equipped). A comprehensive list of such suffixes can be found here.\n\nFinish (color) codes\nFor More about this topic, see List of finishes.\nLast but not least, a word about finishes: it is important to know that the color of the guitar is NOT part of the model number. For example the ARZ300 is available in black (ARZ300 BK) and white (ARZ300 WH) but since they both are the same model fundamentally, they share the same model name. Sometimes, humans may errouneously enter a hyphen between model number and color, e.g. ARZ300-WH. Please simply ignore these. We care only about the model number, not the finish.\n\nStandard, Premium and Prestige refer to the quality range of the guitar, not the series. Please ignore these words. The following are valid series:\n{Series}\n\nIf you cannot recognize the series, just say 'unknown'.\n\nYour Task: Given a string such as 'Ibanez RG370DX-BK', tell me the make, series, and model of the guitar. Do NOT include the finish as part of the model name. I repeat, do not. Do include the series as part of the model name. In fact, every model number should start with the series. Format your answer as a json dictionary. Give me only the answer as a json object for the problem I'm giving you. Do not give me any kind of general purpose solution. For the example above, the correct answer would be: {\"make\": \"Ibanez\", \"series\": \"RG\", \"model\": \"RG370DX\"}\n\nGive me the solution for the following string:", "series_confirmation_prompt": "Valid Series of Ibanez guitar models are: \n {series} \n Tell me what series is referred to in the following text. Respond in json from according to the following schema: {\"series\": \"the series you found out\"}. Give only the json as a response, nothing else. Here is the text:"}
